## Overview

This is the fourth project in the responsive web developer path for devchallenges.io

The demo solution I did can be found at https://oinsur.github.io/recipe-blog-page/

I was pleased with my result for the challenge. This was a different experience because there were more icons involved and also text elements.
I was able to get some more practice for working with material icons. I was able to apply transition effect by assigning id's to them. 
What I would like to do in the future is to see if I can use custom animations with material icons.
